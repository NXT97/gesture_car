# gesture_car
Arduino code to make a wired gesture controlled car
this code can drive any standard dc motor driver car
accelerometer like ADXL335 on any breakout boards will work with x and y axis connected to A4 and A5 of arduino(UNO or any other)
the connections are simple, 4 digital output of arduino connected to 4 inputs of driver
optional pwm control can be added by connecting pwm pins of arduino to driver, else keep pwm at 5V
